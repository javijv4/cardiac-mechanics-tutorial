# cardiac-mechanics-tutorial
A cardiac mechanics tutorial using fenicsx

# Getting Started
Before start, we need to install conda or miniconda (either is fine, miniconda is a lightweight version of conda) following the instructions [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

Once conda is installed clone the repository (this will make a folder from wherever folder you are calling the command):
```
git clone https://github.com/javijv4/cardiac-mechanics-tutorial
```
Enter the newly created folder and create the needed python environment to run these files
```
cd cardiac-mechanics-tutorial
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate the environment and start a jupyter-notebook
```
conda activate cardiac-mechanics
jupyter-notebook tutorial
```
